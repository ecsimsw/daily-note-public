## Why does database sharding enhance performance? 
### If the search condition is not based on the shard key, does it still need to search all the sharding database servers?

Database sharding is a technique used to improve performance and scalability in large-scale distributed databases. It involves partitioning a database into smaller, more manageable units called shards, where each shard contains a subset of the data.

When a search condition is based on the shard key, the database can quickly identify the specific shard that contains the data being searched. This allows the search to be performed directly on that shard, avoiding the need to search all the shards.

However, if the search condition is not based on the shard key, the database will indeed need to search across multiple shards. In this case, the performance benefits of sharding may not be as significant since the search operation must be distributed across multiple shard servers.

Nevertheless, there are still potential performance improvements with sharding even when searching across multiple shards. <b> By distributing the data across multiple servers, sharding allows for parallel processing of queries. Each shard can execute the search operation independently, which can result in faster overall query performance compared to a non-sharded database where a single server handles all the queries. </b>

It's worth noting that the effectiveness of sharding for improving performance depends on various factors, such as the specific workload, data distribution, and the ability to efficiently route queries to the relevant shards. Additionally, sharding introduces complexity in terms of data management, consistency, and handling distributed transactions, which need to be carefully considered and addressed when implementing a sharded database architecture.
