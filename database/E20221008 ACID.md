## ACID

### Atomicity
It means the transaction can either be completed or fails completely. There is not a partial completion of the transaction in it.   

### Consistency
The database always is in a consistent state while the transactions are at the beginning and end. The data should be consistent when the transaction begins and ends.    

### Isolation
Isolation is the main property as it means when two transactions are being held at the same time we get the same result when the transaction is executed in sequence or the transaction is executed in parallel.   

### Durability
When the transaction is being ended it cannot be reversed as stated by this property of transaction. It also states that any changes in transactions should be saved.

## Example of ACID transactions 

We have to send 50 from S1 to S2 so we have to know here how the ACID transaction works in such an operation:

### 1. Atomicity

The atomicity ensures that the full operation takes place or is aborted back. It ensures that both operations take place or neither even one cannot take place.

First operation  S1 : A – 50;    
Second operation  S2 : B + 50;

### 2. Consistency

Consistency property ensures that the integrity of transactions is maintained properly. Such as:

Before transaction S1 : A + B = 150. ( A = 100, B = 50).    
After transaction : S2 : A + B = 150. ( A = 50, B = 100).

### 3. Isolation

Isolation ensures that if the two transactions are going on no other transaction can be accessed between them. It means two operations can be done at one time and no other operation or task can interfere with them.

Such as if two operations such as A – 50 and B + 50 are working no third transaction can interfere with them.

### 4. Durability

As we discussed above one time it completes the operation cannot be reversed after it. If all transactions are completed it cannot go back to its previous steps.
