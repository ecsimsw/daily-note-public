#### Types of NoSQL Database:
- Key-Value : They contain only keys and values which is why they are called simpler types of databases. (Redis, Riak, Amazon Dynamo DB)   
- Document : In these databases, they contain fields and values and they always store the document similar to JSON. (MongoDB, CouthDB)      
- Wide Column Stores : These are the special NoSQL databases because they store data in form of tables, rows, and columns.    
- Graph Databases : Here are Nodes and Edges present where nodes are used for storing information about places, things, and people also. while edges are used for storing information regarding the relationship between the nodes.
